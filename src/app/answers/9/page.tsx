			<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">9. What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?</h1>
			<p>I think the most common problems Vercel customers encounter involve deployment errors or issues with serverless functions.</p>

			<p className="mb-2">Some short-term approaches to overcoming these problems could include:</p>
			<ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-2">
				<li className="mb-2">Diagnosing errors using Vercel's logs or error messages.</li>
				<li className="mb-2">Ensure that <code>vercel.json</code> is correctly set up, with routes and builds properly defined.</li>
				<li className="mb-2">Verify that all necessary environment variables are correctly added in the Vercel dashboard and match those in the <code>.env</code> file.</li>
			</ul>

			<p className="mb-2">Some long-term approaches to overcoming these problems could include:</p>
			<ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-2">
				<li className="mb-2">Encourage customers to familiarize themselves with Vercel's documentation and guides to understand best practices and common pitfalls.</li>
				<li className="mb-2">Guide customers to engage with the Vercel community, where they can find additional help and share experiences.</li>
				<li className="mb-2">Lastly, I could offer training sessions or resources to help customers understand the nuances of deploying and managing serverless applications on Vercel.</li>
			</ul>
