			<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">10. How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise? </h1>
			<p className="mb-2">First of all, I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the exercise. Having previously heard of Vercel and Next.js, this was my first experience using them. I had a lot of fun working with the platform and was constantly surprised at all the thoughtful design nuances and intuitive features present. I found myself spending lots of time just playing around.</p>

			<p className="mb-2">As for potential improvements to the exercise, I would suggest setting a design goal. While I understand this was certainly not the intent of the exercise, providing a reference layout would be helpful, so as not to waste too much time on the design aspect of the exercise.</p>

			<p className="mb-2">Additionally, while I thought the questions were actually very well thought out and interesting to answer, I think it might be ambitious to properly answer all 10 in the space of 3 hours, while also setting up the platform and establishing a foundational project that is presentable.</p>

			<p className="mb-2">All these are minor gripes at the end of the day, and I will say I think this was one of the most interesting technical exercises I have come across.</p>

			<p className="mb-2">Thank you for the opportunity, and I'm looking forward to hearing from you :)</p>
